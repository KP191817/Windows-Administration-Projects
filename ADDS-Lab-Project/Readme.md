# üßæ Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) Lab Project

## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates the **installation, configuration, and management of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** in a **Windows Server 2022** environment.  
The lab also includes **Group Policy Management (GPO)**, **DNS/DHCP setup**, **File Server sharing**, and **User & Group administration** ‚Äî providing a complete system administration experience.

## üéØ Objectives

- Install and configure **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**  
- Set up a new **domain and forest** (e.g., `Corp.local`)  
- Create and manage **Users, Groups, and Organizational Units (OUs)**  
- Implement **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** for centralized control  
- Configure **DNS and DHCP** for name resolution and IP assignment  
- Set up **File Server sharing** with NTFS and share permissions  
- Join a **Windows 10 client** to the domain and test connectivity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Configure ADDS
- Install **Active Directory Domain Services** role via Server Manager  
- Promote the server to a **Domain Controller**  
- Create a new **forest** and **domain**  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Organize OUs, Users, and Groups
- Create **Organizational Units** for departments (e.g., IT, HR, Sales)  
- Add domain **users and security groups**  
- Apply group memberships and logon restrictions  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DNS and DHCP
- Set up **forward lookup zones** in DNS  
- Configure **DHCP scopes** for automatic IP assignment  
- Integrate DHCP with Active Directory for secure updates  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Use **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**  
- Create policies for:  
  - Password complexity and expiration  
  - Desktop wallpaper enforcement  
  - Drive mapping and restrictions  
- Apply GPOs to specific OUs  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure File Server Sharing
- Create shared folders (e.g., `\\SHAREFOLDER`)  
- Apply **NTFS** and **Share Permissions**  
- Test access using different domain user accounts  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Join Windows 10 Client to Domain
- Configure client‚Äôs DNS to point to domain controller  
- Join domain via **System Properties ‚Üí Domain Join**  
- Log in with domain credentials and test GPO/permissions

## üß™ Testing and Verification

- Ping server and domain name from client machine  
- Verify user logins and GPOs applied using `gpresult /r`  
- Check file access based on group permissions  
- Confirm DHCP IP assignment and DNS resolution
